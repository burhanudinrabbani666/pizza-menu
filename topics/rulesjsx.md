## General JSX rules

- JSX works essentially like HTML, but we can enter "JavaScript mode" by using {} (for text or atributes)
- We can place any JavaScript inside {}. Example: reference variables, create arrays of objects, [].map(), ternary operator.
- statements are not alowed(is, else, for , swiwtch)
- A piece of JSX can only have **one root element**. if you need more, use <React.Fragment> (or the Short <>)
